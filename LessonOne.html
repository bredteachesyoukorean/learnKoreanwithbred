    <h2>안녕하세요! Hello!</h2>
    Welcome to the first ever Korean lesson in this series. When learning Korean, you obviously must be able to read it. and
    to read a language, you need to know the alphabet. Which is why, the first thing you must learn in Korean, is the Korean
    alphabet, or Hangul (한글)

    <h3>Consonants:</h3>
    Just like in English, there are not very many letters. In fact, there are less than in English. To be exact, 24 Korean
    letters are in 한글 (the Korean alphabet; pronounced "hangeul")
    <p>ㄱ - This letter is the same as the English "g". It often sounds like a "k" though. Another thing to remember,
        is that when ㄱ is combined with some other letters, it will look like this "가." You have not learned ㅏ yet, but
        just know that the g can be curved as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        ㄴ - This letter is the same as the English "n". It always sounds like "n". This one will never become curved like ㄱ
        does.
    </p>
    <p>
        ㄷ - This letter is the same as the English "d". It almost always sounds like a "d" but sometimes it is pronounced
        more like a "t".
    </p>
    <p>
        ㄹ - This letter is the same as the English "L". It will sometimes sound like an l, and sometimes an r, but most of 
        the time it will sound like an l. Also, remember that with asian languages, l often sounds like "d" or a tongue roll,
        but this will most likely come naturally. 
    </p>
    <p>
        ㅁ - Most likely one of the easiest to remember -- The same as the English "m". Like ㄴ, it will always sound like an
        "m".
    </p>
    <p>
        ㅂ - This letter is the same as the English "b". It will <i>occasionally</i> sound like the letter "p" but you can almost 
        always confidently pronounce this as a "b".
    </p>
